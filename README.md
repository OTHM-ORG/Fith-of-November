# Fith-of-November
Could you remember
the words that would render
on pages, long long ago
we could stop and realise
those broken ties
with the seeds they left to sow.

The name of this part of the othm project is inspired by the now defunct webcomic [somethingofthatilk](https://web.archive.org/web/20140825231537/http://somethingofthatilk.com/index.php?id=), and as a reminder to how time and massive amounts of information cause gems to be lost and forgotten, but their influence to live on.

This project is one of time, forgetting, and influence.

Sometimes I remember
the fith of November
though honestly, it is bearable
with our tries
and yesterday's unsuccessful suprise
I start again a new parable
