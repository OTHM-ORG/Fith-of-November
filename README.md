# Fith-of-November
Could you remember  
the words that would render  
on pages, long long ago  
we could stop and realise  
those broken ties  
with the seeds they left to sow.  

The name of this part of the othm project is inspired by the now defunct webcomic [somethingofthatilk](https://web.archive.org/web/20140825231537/http://somethingofthatilk.com/index.php?id=), and as a reminder to how time and massive amounts of information cause gems to be lost and forgotten, but their influence to live on.

This project is one of time, forgetting, and influence.

Sometimes I remember  
the fith of November  
though honestly, it is bearable  
with our tries  
and yesterday's unsuccessful suprise  
I start again a new parable
